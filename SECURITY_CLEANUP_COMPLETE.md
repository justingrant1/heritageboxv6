# Security Cleanup Complete

## Overview
Successfully removed sensitive environment variables from Git history and secured the repository.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Environment Variables Removed from History
- **SHIPPO_API_TOKEN**: Shipping service API key
- **AIRTABLE_API_KEY**: Database API key  
- **AIRTABLE_BASE_ID**: Database identifier
- **STRIPE_SECRET_KEY**: Payment processing key
- **STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY**: Payment processing key
- **BREVO_API_KEY**: Email service API key

### 2. Git History Cleanup
- Used `git filter-branch` to remove `.env` file from entire Git history
- Force pushed cleaned history to GitHub repository
- Cleaned up backup references and ran garbage collection
- Repository size optimized after cleanup

### 3. Security Measures Implemented
- Created `.env.example` with placeholder values for documentation
- Ensured `.env` is properly ignored in `.gitignore`
- All sensitive data removed from public repository

## Current Status
✅ **SECURE**: No sensitive environment variables remain in Git history  
✅ **CLEAN**: Repository history has been rewritten and optimized  
✅ **DOCUMENTED**: Safe example file created for future reference  

## Next Steps
- Regenerate all API keys that were exposed (recommended security practice)
- Update deployment environment with new keys
- Verify all services continue working with regenerated keys

## Files Modified
- Removed: `.env` from entire Git history
- Added: `.env.example` with safe placeholder values
- Maintained: `.gitignore` entries for environment files

The repository is now secure and ready for continued development.
