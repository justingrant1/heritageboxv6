# Stripe ZIP Code UX Improvement Complete

## Problem Identified
After completing the Stripe migration, user feedback revealed that the ZIP code field in the Stripe payment form wasn't clearly visible or obvious to users. The Stripe CardElement combines all card fields (number, expiry, CVC, and ZIP) into a single input field, making it unclear when the ZIP code still needs to be entered.

## User Experience Issue
- Users would complete autofill for card number, expiry, and CVC
- ZIP code field wasn't prominently highlighted
- No clear indication that ZIP code was required
- Users might attempt to submit payment without completing ZIP code

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Clear Instructions
**Before Payment Form:**
- Added blue information box with card icon
- Clear text: "üí≥ Enter your card number, expiry date, CVC, and ZIP code in the field below"
- Subtitle: "All fields are required. Make sure to complete the ZIP code field at the end."

### 2. Enhanced Visual Cues
**Card Input Field:**
- Added white background to make field more prominent
- Maintained focus border styling for better interaction feedback

### 3. ZIP Code Reminder
**Below Payment Form:**
- Added yellow warning box with attention icon
- Text: "‚ö†Ô∏è Don't forget to enter your ZIP code in the card field above"
- Positioned strategically after the card input field

### 4. Improved Layout Structure
- Clear visual hierarchy with proper spacing
- Color-coded information boxes (blue for instructions, yellow for reminders)
- Consistent styling with existing design system

## Technical Implementation

### Added Instruction Box:
```tsx
<div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 rounded-lg p-3 mb-4">
  <p className="text-sm text-blue-800 font-medium">
    üí≥ Enter your card number, expiry date, CVC, and ZIP code in the field below
  </p>
  <p className="text-xs text-blue-600 mt-1">
    All fields are required. Make sure to complete the ZIP code field at the end.
  </p>
</div>
```

### Enhanced Card Input:
```tsx
<div className="p-4 border-2 border-gray-200 rounded-xl focus-within:border-primary transition-colors bg-white">
  <CardElement options={cardElementOptions} />
</div>
```

### ZIP Code Reminder:
```tsx
<div className="flex items-center gap-2 text-sm text-gray-600 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg p-2">
  <span className="text-yellow-600">‚ö†Ô∏è</span>
  <span>Don't forget to enter your ZIP code in the card field above</span>
