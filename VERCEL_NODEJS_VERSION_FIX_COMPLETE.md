# Vercel Node.js Version Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue
Vercel build was failing with the error:
```
Error: Found invalid Node.js Version: "22.x". Please set Node.js Version to 20.x in your Project Settings to use Node.js 20.
```

## Root Cause
The project was configured to use Node.js 22.x, but Vercel requires Node.js 20.x for the current runtime environment.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added .nvmrc File
Created `.nvmrc` file to specify Node.js version 20:
```
20
```

### 2. Updated vercel.json Runtime
Changed the runtime specification in `vercel.json` from:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "@vercel/node@3.0.27"
    }
  }
}
```

To:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/*.ts": {
      "runtime": "nodejs20.x"
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Modified
- `.nvmrc` - Created to specify Node.js 20
- `vercel.json` - Updated runtime to use nodejs20.x

## Expected Result
The next Vercel deployment should:
1. Use Node.js 20.x as specified in the configuration
2. Successfully build the project without Node.js version errors
3. Deploy the API functions with the correct runtime environment

## Additional Notes
- The `.nvmrc` file helps ensure consistent Node.js versions across development and deployment environments
- The `nodejs20.x` runtime specification in vercel.json explicitly tells Vercel which Node.js version to use for serverless functions
- This fix addresses the deployment issue while maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase

## Status
✅ **Node.js Version Configuration:** FIXED
✅ **Vercel Runtime Specification:** UPDATED
✅ **Ready for Deployment:** YES

The project should now deploy successfully on Vercel with Node.js 20.x.
