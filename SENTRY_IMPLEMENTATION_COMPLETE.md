# Sentry Error Tracking Implementation Complete

## Overview
Sentry error tracking has been successfully implemented in your React application. This provides comprehensive error monitoring, performance tracking, and session replay capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Sentry SDK Installation
- Installed `@sentry/react` package
- Configured with your provided DSN

### 2. Core Configuration (src/main.tsx)
- Sentry initialization with your DSN
- Browser tracing integration for performance monitoring
- Session replay integration for debugging
- Environment-based configuration (development vs production)
- Different sample rates for development and production

### 3. Error Boundary Component (src/components/SentryErrorBoundary.tsx)
- Custom error boundary wrapper using Sentry's ErrorBoundary
- Provides user-friendly error messages
- Automatically reports errors to Sentry
- Shows error dialog for user feedback

### 4. Utility Functions (src/utils/sentryUtils.ts)
- `captureError()` - Capture exceptions with context
- `captureMessage()` - Send custom messages to Sentry
- `setUserContext()` - Associate errors with specific users
- `addBreadcrumb()` - Add custom breadcrumbs for debugging
- `setTag()` - Add tags to organize errors
- `setContext()` - Add additional context to errors
- `measurePerformance()` - Simple performance monitoring

## Configuration Details

### DSN
Your Sentry DSN is configured: `https://9c294a8d114361c4d14f915bac0d2435@o4509873209999360.ingest.us.sentry.io/4509873238573056`

### Sample Rates
- **Development**: 
  - Performance traces: 100%
  - Session replays: 50%
- **Production**: 
  - Performance traces: 10%
  - Session replays: 10%
- **Error replays**: 100% (always capture when errors occur)

### Features Enabled
- ✅ Error tracking
- ✅ Performance monitoring
- ✅ Session replay
- ✅ Browser tracing
- ✅ User feedback dialogs
- ✅ Breadcrumbs
- ✅ User context
- ✅ Custom tags and context

## How to Use

### Basic Error Tracking
Errors are automatically captured, but you can also manually capture them:

```typescript
import { captureError, captureMessage } from '@/utils/sentryUtils';

try {
  // Some risky operation
  riskyFunction();
} catch (error) {
  captureError(error as Error, {
    component: 'PaymentForm',
    userId: user.id,
    action: 'process_payment'
  });
}
```

### Adding User Context
```typescript
import { setUserContext } from '@/utils/sentryUtils';

// When user logs in
setUserContext({
  id: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  username: user.username
});
```

### Adding Breadcrumbs
```typescript
import { addBreadcrumb } from '@/utils/sentryUtils';

addBreadcrumb('User clicked checkout button', 'user-action', 'info');
```

### Using Error Boundary
Wrap components that might throw errors:

```typescript
import SentryErrorBoundary from '@/components/SentryErrorBoundary';

<SentryErrorBoundary>
  <YourComponent />
</SentryErrorBoundary>
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
import { measurePerformance } from '@/utils/sentryUtils';

measurePerformance('data-processing', () => {
  // Your expensive operation
  processLargeDataset();
});
```

## Environment Variables (Optional)
You can add these to your `.env` file for more flexibility:

```env
VITE_SENTRY_DSN=https://9c294a8d114361c4d14f915bac0d2435@o4509873209999360.ingest.us.sentry.io/4509873238573056
VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

## What You'll See in Sentry Dashboard

1. **Errors**: All JavaScript errors with stack traces
2. **Performance**: Page load times, API call durations
3. **Session Replays**: Video-like recordings of user sessions when errors occur
4. **User Feedback**: When users encounter errors, they can provide feedback
5. **Breadcrumbs**: Trail of user actions leading to errors
6. **User Context**: Which users are experiencing issues

## Testing the Implementation

To test that Sentry is working:

1. **Start your development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Trigger a test error** (you can add this temporarily to any component):
   ```typescript
   import { captureError } from '@/utils/sentryUtils';
   
   const testSentry = () => {
     captureError(new Error('Test error for Sentry'), {
       test: true,
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
     });
   };
   ```

3. **Check your Sentry dashboard** at https://sentry.io to see the error appear

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor your Sentry dashboard** for incoming errors
2. **Set up alerts** in Sentry to notify you of critical errors
3. **Configure release tracking** to see which deployments introduce issues
4. **Set up performance budgets** to monitor app performance over time
5. **Use the session replay feature** to debug complex user issues

## Benefits

- **Proactive Error Detection**: Know about errors before users report them
- **Better Debugging**: See exactly what users were doing when errors occurred
- **Performance Insights**: Monitor your app's performance in real-time
- **User Experience**: Provide better support with detailed error context
- **Release Confidence**: Track error rates across deployments

Your Sentry implementation is now complete and ready to help you maintain a high-quality user experience!
