# Stripe Payment 504 Timeout Fix - COMPLETE âœ…

## Issue Identified
After fixing the ES module conflicts, the Stripe payment API started returning 504 Gateway Timeout errors, causing payment processing to fail completely.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `api/process-stripe-payment.ts` was configured to use Vercel's Edge Runtime (`runtime: 'edge'`), which has several limitations:

1. **Timeout Limitations**: Edge Runtime has stricter timeout limits
2. **API Complexity**: The Stripe payment processing involves multiple API calls:
   - Stripe customer creation
   - Payment intent creation with comprehensive metadata
   - Airtable integration for order storage
   - Shipping label generation workflow
3. **Resource Constraints**: Edge Runtime has limited memory and processing capabilities
4. **Network Limitations**: Complex external API integrations can timeout in Edge Runtime

## Error Symptoms
- Frontend showed: `ðŸ’³ PAYMENT ERROR: SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'A', "An error o"... is not valid JSON`
- API returned 504 Gateway Timeout
- Payment processing completely failed despite successful Stripe frontend validation

## Solution Applied
âœ… **Changed Runtime from Edge to Node.js**

**Before:**
```typescript
export const config = {
    runtime: 'edge',
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
export const config = {
    runtime: 'nodejs',
};
```

## Why Node.js Runtime Fixes This
1. **Higher Timeout Limits**: Node.js runtime allows longer execution times
2. **Better Resource Allocation**: More memory and processing power available
3. **Full Node.js API Support**: Complete access to Node.js features and libraries
4. **Optimized for Complex Operations**: Better suited for multi-step payment processing
5. **Consistent with Other APIs**: Matches the runtime used by `create-order.ts` and other APIs

## Files Modified
- `api/process-stripe-payment.ts` - Changed runtime from 'edge' to 'nodejs'

## Payment Processing Flow
The API handles a complex workflow:
1. **Customer Creation**: Creates/updates Stripe customer with full address data
2. **Payment Processing**: Creates payment intent with comprehensive metadata
3. **Order Storage**: Saves order details to Airtable with normalized data structure
4. **Shipping Integration**: Automatically generates shipping labels via Shippo API
5. **Data Synchronization**: Updates Airtable with shipping tracking information

## Deployment Status
- âœ… **Commit b08ece6**: Stripe payment runtime fix applied
- âœ… **Commit 6376a50**: Node.js runtime headers API fix applied
- âœ… **Commit a21921d**: Node.js runtime request body parsing fix applied
- âœ… **Commit 672a9e2**: Node.js runtime URL construction fix applied
- âœ… **All changes pushed** to GitHub main branch
- âœ… **Vercel deployment** triggered automatically
- âœ… **Repository fully synchronized**

## Additional Fixes Applied

### Fix #2: Headers API Compatibility
After switching to Node.js runtime, discovered that `request.headers.entries()` method doesn't exist in Node.js runtime environment. Fixed by removing the `.entries()` call and passing headers directly.

**Error Fixed:**
```
TypeError: request.headers.entries is not a function
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Before (Edge Runtime compatible)
headers: Object.fromEntries(request.headers.entries())

// After (Node.js Runtime compatible)  
headers: request.headers
```

### Fix #3: Request Body Parsing
After fixing headers, discovered that `request.json()` method doesn't exist in Node.js runtime environment. Fixed by implementing proper Node.js stream-based request body parsing.

**Error Fixed:**
```
TypeError: request.json is not a function
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Before (Edge Runtime compatible)
const body = await request.json();

// After (Node.js Runtime compatible)
let rawBody = '';
request.on('data', (chunk: any) => {
    rawBody += chunk.toString();
});

await new Promise((resolve) => {
    request.on('end', resolve);
});

const body = JSON.parse(rawBody);
```

## Expected Results
- âœ… Stripe payments should process without 504 timeouts
- âœ… Payment API should handle complex multi-step workflows
- âœ… Order creation and shipping label generation should work seamlessly
- âœ… Full payment-to-fulfillment automation restored

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test a complete payment flow with the 99DOFF coupon
2. Verify order creation in Airtable
3. Confirm shipping label generation
4. Check payment confirmation emails
5. Validate order tracking information

## Related Fixes
This fix builds on previous ES module conflict resolutions:
- Removed `"type": "module"` from package.json
- Fixed lovable-tagger ESM import in vite.config.ts
- Ensured all API endpoints use consistent Node.js runtime
