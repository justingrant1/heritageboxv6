# SERVICE COMBINATIONS GENERATION FIX - COMPLETE âœ…

## Problem Identified and Resolved

### Issue
The `serviceCombinations.ts` file was only generating 5 pages instead of the expected 75 pages (5 services Ã— 15 locations).

### Root Cause
The filtering logic was working correctly, but there was a syntax error in the nested loops that prevented proper generation of all combinations.

### Solution Applied
1. **Identified the Problem**: Used debugging to trace through the generation process
2. **Fixed Syntax Errors**: Corrected missing braces and try-catch structure
3. **Verified the Fix**: Browser console shows 75 combinations being generated successfully

## Verification Results
