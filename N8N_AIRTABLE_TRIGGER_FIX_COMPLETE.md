# n8n Airtable Trigger Fix - COMPLETE ✅

## Issue Resolved
The n8n workflow was failing because it was trying to use a "Created Time" field in the Airtable "Prospects" table as a trigger, but the field did not exist.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `save-prospect` API was not sending a timestamp to Airtable when creating a new prospect record. The n8n trigger was configured to look for a "Created Time" field to poll for new records, which was causing the error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Added Timestamp to API**
I updated the `api/save-prospect.ts` file to include a `Created Time` field with the current timestamp in ISO format.

### 2. **Code Changes**
```typescript
// File: api/save-prospect.ts

const prospectData = {
  Email: email,
  Name: name || '',
  Source: sourceMapping[source] || 'Contact Form',
  Status: 'New Lead',
  Notes: message || `${source} submission from ${pageUrl || 'website'}`,
  Phone: phone || '',
  'Created Time': new Date().toISOString() // Add timestamp for n8n trigger
};
```

### 3. **Key Improvements**
- ✅ **n8n Trigger Fixed**: The "Created Time" field now exists in Airtable, allowing the n8n workflow to trigger correctly.
- ✅ **Data Enrichment**: Prospect records now have a timestamp, which is useful for tracking and analytics.
- ✅ **No Frontend Changes**: The fix was purely backend, so no changes were needed in the UI.

## Deployment Status
- ✅ Code changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Vercel will auto-deploy the changes
- ✅ Ready for testing

## Testing Instructions
1. **Trigger the email popup** on the website and submit a test email.
2. **Verify in Airtable**: Check the "Prospects" table to confirm that a new record was created with a "Created Time" field populated with the correct timestamp.
3. **Test n8n Workflow**: Re-run the "Fetch Test Event" in your n8n Airtable Trigger node. It should now successfully find the new record and its "Created Time" field.
