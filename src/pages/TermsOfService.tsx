              <p className="mb-4">
                HERITAGEBOX offers the service of transferring and converting various media into different forms but it does not provide any services which relates to shipment of such media to or from its offices. Any services purchased from HERITAGEBOX are custom-made based on a shipment contract. Hence, the risk of loss of your media passes to HERITAGEBOX only when such material is received in our offices, and terminates and revert back to you once HERITAGEBOX deliver your media to a shipping carrier either FedEx, USPS, DHL, etc. Your act of shipping any media to HERITAGEBOX constitute your acknowledgement that the company is not responsible for late, damaged, lost or misdirected mail.

                In no instance shall HERITAGEBOX guarantee that your media will not be damaged accidentally while in transit or under the possession of the shipping carrier, nor does the company assume the risk of loss of any loss media while being transited.

                You likewise further acknowledge and agree that such safe handling guarantee is a reasonable estimate of the damages suffered by you as a result of the loss of your order and the same does not amount to a penalty imposed against HERITAGEBOX.

                In arbitration, there is no judge or jury and therefore the court's review of an arbitral award is limited. However, it is within the tenets of the power of the arbitrator to award the same damages and relief as a court on an individual basis may award, following and applying these Terms of Use as any court would do.

              <p className="mb-4">
                In commencing an arbitration proceeding, you must first send a letter requesting for arbitration describing your claim to our registered agent at HERITAGEBOX:

                The arbitration is to be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The rules adhered by the AAA can be accessed through www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879 and payment of all filing fees, administration and arbitrator fees shall be governed by the AAA's rules.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You also agree that whenever possible and practicable under all relevant rules, the arbitration shall be conducted in the State of Florida in North Bay Village or as close to said venue as possible. If not possible under all relevant rules to be conducted in the State of Florida, then you agree that the arbitration can be conducted through teleconferencing which is usually cheaper and more convenient for both parties, or may be based solely on written submissions by the parties.
