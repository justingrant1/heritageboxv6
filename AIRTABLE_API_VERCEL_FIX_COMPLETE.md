# Airtable API Vercel Serverless Function Fix - COMPLETE

## Issue Identified
The `/api/create-order.ts` endpoint was failing with the error:
```
"request.json is not a function"
```

This was causing immediate failures and 30-second timeouts on Vercel.

## Root Cause
The API endpoint was written using Web API `Request` format instead of Vercel's serverless function format:
- ❌ **Wrong**: `handler(request: Request)` with `request.json()`
- ✅ **Correct**: `handler(req: VercelRequest, res: VercelResponse)` with `req.body`

## Fix Applied
1. **Converted API Format**: Changed from Web API to Vercel serverless function format
2. **Fixed Request Handling**: 
   - Changed `request.json()` to `req.body`
   - Changed `new Response()` to `res.status().json()`
3. **Added Proper Types**: Created custom Vercel types instead of Next.js dependencies
4. **Maintained All Functionality**: 
   - Order number generation (starting from 100420, incrementing by 5)
   - Customer creation/lookup by email
   - Product creation/lookup by SKU
   - Order and order items creation
   - Comprehensive logging

## Verification Status
- ✅ **Code Fixed**: API endpoint converted to correct Vercel format
- ✅ **Types Fixed**: Removed Next.js dependency, added custom Vercel types
- ✅ **GitHub Updated**: Changes committed and pushed to repository
- ✅ **Airtable Configuration**: Confirmed working (API key, base ID, table access)

## Expected Results
The checkout process should now:
1. Successfully process payments via Stripe
2. Create orders in Airtable without timeout errors
3. Generate proper order numbers (100420, 100425, 100430, etc.)
4. Create customer records and link them to orders
5. Create product records for packages and add-ons
6. Complete within the 30-second Vercel timeout limit

## Next Steps
1. Test a complete checkout flow to verify the fix
2. Monitor Vercel logs for successful order creation
3. Check Airtable for new orders appearing correctly

## Files Modified
- `api/create-order.ts` - Converted from Web API to Vercel serverless function format

## Commit Details

- **Message**: "Fix Airtable API endpoint - convert from Web API to Vercel serverless function format"
