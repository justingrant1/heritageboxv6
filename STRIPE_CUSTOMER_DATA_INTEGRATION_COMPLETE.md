# Stripe Customer Data Integration Complete

## Problem Identified
While Stripe payments were processing successfully, customer data and product information weren't flowing through to Stripe. The Stripe dashboard only showed:
- Payment amounts
- Basic account ID metadata
- No customer information
- No order details
- No product information

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Payment Processing Flow
Updated `api/process-stripe-payment.ts` to include a comprehensive 3-step process:

#### Step 1: Stripe Customer Creation
- **Before**: No customer records were created in Stripe
- **After**: Creates Stripe customer records with complete information:
  - Full name and email
  - Phone number
  - Complete billing address
  - Customer metadata (first name, last name)

#### Step 2: Comprehensive Metadata Collection
- **Before**: Only `account_id` metadata
- **After**: Detailed metadata including:
  - **Customer Info**: Name, email, phone, full address
  - **Order Details**: Package type, pricing, subtotal, total
  - **Product Info**: Digitizing speed, processing time, add-ons
  - **Discounts**: Coupon codes, discount percentages and amounts

#### Step 3: Enhanced Payment Intent Creation
- **Before**: Basic payment intent with minimal data
- **After**: Rich payment intent with:
  - Linked customer record
  - Descriptive payment description
  - Receipt email configuration
  - Complete order metadata

### 2. Data Flow Improvements

```
- Customer Name: Full name for easy identification

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Customer Creation Process:

const customerResponse = await fetch('https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${stripeSecretKey}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    },
    body: new URLSearchParams({
        email: customerInfo.email,
        name: customerInfo.fullName,
        phone: customerInfo.phone || '',
        'address[line1]': customerInfo.address || '',
        'address[city]': customerInfo.city || '',
        'address[state]': customerInfo.state || '',
        'address[postal_code]': customerInfo.zipCode || '',
        'address[country]': 'US',
        'metadata[first_name]': customerInfo.firstName,
        'metadata[last_name]': customerInfo.lastName
    })
});
```

#### Metadata Structure:
```typescript
const metadata: { [key: string]: string } = {
    account_id: 'acct_1RoprfEr0BqcN5eb',
    customer_name: 'John Smith',
    customer_email: 'john@example.com',
    customer_phone: '555-123-4567',

    digitizing_speed: 'Standard',
    digitizing_time: '4-6 weeks',
    add_ons: '1 USB Drive(s) - $24.95'
};
```

#### Enhanced Payment Intent:
```typescript
const paymentIntentParams = new URLSearchParams({
    amount: Math.round(amount * 100).toString(),
    currency: 'usd',
    payment_method: paymentMethod.id,
    confirm: 'true',
    customer: stripeCustomerId,
    receipt_email: customerInfo.email,
    description: `Heritage Box ${package} Package - ${speed} Processing`,
    // ... all metadata fields
});
```
